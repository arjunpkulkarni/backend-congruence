This incongruence suggests a potential masking of true feelings or uncertainty despite a seemingly confident facial expression. [t: 2.1–16.8 s; text_v: -0.059; face_v: 0.632; audio_v: -0.125]"

This divergence between the text's positive assertion and the face/audio's negative metrics suggests a lack of genuine confidence or possible sarcasm in the claim.
