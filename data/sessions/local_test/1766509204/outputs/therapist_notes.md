- **Recurring Themes**: No recurring themes were identifiable due to the limited interaction.

- **Therapeutic Interventions to Consider**:
  - Utilize open-ended questions to facilitate more comprehensive expression.
  - Consider employing reflective listening to validate the patient's feelings and encourage deeper exploration.
- **Follow-up Actions**:
  - Schedule a longer session to allow for more in-depth discussion.
  - Monitor for any changes in emotional expression or verbal communication patterns.
