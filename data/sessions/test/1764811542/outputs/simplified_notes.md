## 2️⃣ INCONGRUENCE MARKERS

**3 incongruent moment(s) observed**

*These are timestamps where verbal content and non-verbal signals (face/voice) don't match.*

### Moment 1: 00:03 - 00:05

**Type:** `smiling_but_voice_shows_stress`

**Observation:**
Facial expression appears positive/happy (face valence: +0.93), but vocal tone suggests tension or negativity (audio valence: -0.13). This face-voice mismatch may indicate client is putting on a brave face while experiencing distress.

**What was said:**
> "My name is, wait can I give it lies to? Just say anything."

**Measurements:**
- Verbal tone: +0.00 (negative ← 0 → positive)
- Face expression: +0.93
- Voice tone: -0.12
- Overall intensity: 0.68

### Moment 2: 00:07 - 00:10

**Type:** `smiling_but_voice_shows_stress`

**Observation:**
Facial expression appears positive/happy (face valence: +0.83), but vocal tone suggests tension or negativity (audio valence: -0.13). This face-voice mismatch may indicate client is putting on a brave face while experiencing distress.

**What was said:**
> "Alright, my name is Rob Wazowski. I'm 21 years old."

**Measurements:**
- Verbal tone: +0.00 (negative ← 0 → positive)
- Face expression: +0.83
- Voice tone: -0.12
- Overall intensity: 0.63

### Moment 3: 00:12 - 00:13

**Type:** `smiling_but_voice_shows_stress`

**Observation:**
Facial expression appears positive/happy (face valence: +0.86), but vocal tone suggests tension or negativity (audio valence: -0.13). This face-voice mismatch may indicate client is putting on a brave face while experiencing distress.

**What was said:**
> "I'm 21 years old."

**Measurements:**
- Verbal tone: +0.00 (negative ← 0 → positive)
- Face expression: +0.86
- Voice tone: -0.12
- Overall intensity: 0.64

## 3️⃣ PATTERN REPETITION

*No similar patterns found in previous sessions.*

This could indicate:
- New emotional territory being explored
- Progress/change from previous patterns
- First session or limited history

---

## CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS

- **Multiple incongruent moments**: Client may be struggling to express authentic emotions, presenting a facade, or experiencing internal conflict about what they're discussing.

---

## METHODOLOGY NOTE

This analysis is based on three objective signals:
1. **Emotional intensity** from facial and vocal activation (not emotion categories)
2. **Incongruence markers** where words and physiology don't match
3. **Pattern recognition** comparing to previous sessions

*No diagnoses or predictions are made. These are observations to inform clinical judgment.*
