This divergence highlights a conflict between text and audio modalities. [t: 2.1–16.8 s; text_v: -0.057; face_v: 0.632; audio_v: -0.125]"

      "reason": "The speaker's verbal content, stating \"I have a million dollars,\" suggests a confident assertion; however, the negative valence in both facial expressions (-0.0498) and audio tone (-0.1250) indicates a lack of genuine confidence or happiness, revealing a divergence between text and non-verbal modalities. This incongruence suggests potential insincerity or discomfort regarding the claim made. [t: 19.1–28.0 s; text_v: 0.0596; face_v: -0.0498; audio_v: -0.1250]."
