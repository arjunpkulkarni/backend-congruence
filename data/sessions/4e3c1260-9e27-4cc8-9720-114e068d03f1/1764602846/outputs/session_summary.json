      "reason": "The speaker's verbal content, stating \"Just say anything,\" reflects a dismissive attitude, yet the facial expression indicates a positive engagement with a mean face valence of 0.632, contrasting sharply with the negative audio valence of -0.125 and the negative text valence of -0.098. This divergence suggests a disconnection between the speaker's verbal assertions and their non-verbal signals, particularly between text vs face and audio vs face modalities. [t: 2.1–16.8 s; text_v: -0.098; face_v: 0.632; audio_v: -0.125]."

      "end": 28.0,
      "reason": "The speaker's claim, \"I have a million dollars in my bank account right now,\" suggests a confident assertion; however, the negative valence in both facial expressions (-0.0498) and audio tone (-0.1250) indicates a lack of genuine confidence or happiness, revealing a divergence between verbal content and non-verbal signals. This incongruence is evident as the text conveys a neutral stance while the face and audio reflect negative emotions. [t: 19.1–28.0 s; text_v: 0.0583; face_v: -0.0498; audio_v: -0.1250]"
